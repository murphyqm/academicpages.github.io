I'm a third year PhD student at the University of Leeds, investigating the origin of pallasite meteorites through both analytical geochemistry and numerical modelling of the pallasite parent body/bodies. 

I'm a member of a number of research groups within the Institute of Geophysics and Tectonics - [Deep Earth](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics/doc/deep-earth), [Rocks, Melts, Fluids](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics/doc/rocks-melts-fluids-1), and last but not least, [Planetary Exploration](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-applied-geoscience/doc/planetary-exploration-1) which I help to organise. While the Covid-19 pandemic has changed how our research groups interact, we've continued to meet online to discuss new research, present novel papers, and deliver seminars on different topics in planetary science.

My recent research interests include investigating the temperature-dependent nature of properties such as conductivity, heat capacity and density in models of conductively cooling planetesimals. Our preprint can be found [here](https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10504913.1). If you have any comments, suggestions or would like to discuss our work, please [email me](mailto:eememq@leeds.ac.uk).

This site is based on the fantastic [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) theme, with a touch more pink added in.
