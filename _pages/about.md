I'm a third year PhD student at the University of Leeds, investigating the origin of pallasite meteorites through both analytical geochemistry of meteorite samples and numerical modelling of the pallasite parent body/bodies.

I'm a member of a number of research groups within the [Institute of Geophysics and Tectonics](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics): [Deep Earth](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics/doc/deep-earth), [Rocks, Melts, Fluids](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics/doc/rocks-melts-fluids-1), and last but not least, [Planetary Exploration](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-applied-geoscience/doc/planetary-exploration-1), which I help to organise. While the Covid-19 pandemic has changed how our research groups interact, we've continued to meet online to discuss new research, present novel papers, and deliver seminars on different topics in planetary science.

My recent research interests include investigating the temperature-dependent nature of properties such as conductivity, heat capacity and density in models of conductively cooling planetesimals. Our preprint discussing this work can be found [here](https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10504913.1). If you have any comments, suggestions or would like to chat about our work, please [email me](mailto:eememq@leeds.ac.uk).

## Research interests and techniques

Over the past year my focus has primarily been on using numerical modelling to investigate the thermal evolution of planetesimals, which has allowed me to continue working despite pandemic-related laboratory closures. We currently have a paper in review that models the conductive cooling of a planetesimal with temperature-dependent conductivity, heat capacity and density, and [we find that approximating these properties as constant significantly alters the thermal evolution of the planetesimal and can lead to different interpretations of meteorite genesis](https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10504913.1).

We are currently preparing the code used in this modelling project to be released as a Python package so that our findings can be easily incorporated into future models of meteorite parent bodies.

When not programming in Python, I can be found using the microprobe or SEM in [LEMAS](https://www.rms.org.uk/network-collaborate/facilities-database/facilities-database-submission-form.html?slug=lemas) to investigate pallasite meteorite samples.
