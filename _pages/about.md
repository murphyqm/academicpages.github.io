I'm a third year PhD student in the Institute of Geophysics and Tectonics at the University of Leeds, investigating the origin of pallasite meteorites through both analytical geochemistry and numerical modelling of the pallasite parent body/bodies. My project is somewhat interdisciplinary, and as I result I'm a member of a number of research groups - [Deep Earth](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics/doc/deep-earth), [Rocks, Melts, Fluids](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-geophysics-tectonics/doc/rocks-melts-fluids-1), and [Planetary Exploration](https://environment.leeds.ac.uk/institute-applied-geoscience/doc/planetary-exploration-1), which I co-organise.

My most recent research is investigating the importance of the temperature-dependend nature of properties such as conductivity, heat capacity and density when modelling conductively cooling planetesimals. Our preprint can be found [here](https://www.essoar.org/doi/abs/10.1002/essoar.10504913.1). If you have any comments, suggestions or would like to discuss our work, please [email me](mailto:eememq@leeds.ac.uk).

This site is based on the fantastic [academicpages](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/) and the [Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) theme, with a touch more pink added in.
